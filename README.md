### A note on changing your NFTs
Let's say you don't like the NFT collection you used for testing and got a better idea. You need to be careful here! Whenever you change your collection, you need to follow the same steps from earlier to deploy the NFTs.

1. Delete the .cache folder that was generated by the Metaplex CLI's candy machine commands.
2. Change up your NFT files to be whatever you want!
3. Run Metaplex's upload command via the CLI to upload the NFTs and create a new candy machine.
4. Run Metaplex's verify command via the CLI to make sure the NFTs were uploaded and the candy machine was properly configured.
5. Update your .env file with the new address.
If you mess up even one of these steps, everything will break. So, watch out.
